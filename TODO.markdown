TODO for Lab 3
==============

* Completion for known friends
	* When you send a message to a friend, their name will be completed next time if they are not busy. This is implemented.
	* However, a friend's name should also be completed when you *receive a message from them*. This is not yet implemented since the messages come as simple strings for now.
* Ensure comments are correct
* Testing
* Use an InetSocketAddress for host and port
